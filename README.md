## Getting Started

<p>
  First, you will need several techs and tools to work with the API.
  In case you have doubts, you could find all the links to all the documentation of each.
</p>

## Requisites

· [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/es/)
<p>First, you'll need to install Node</p>
```sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```
<p>Make sure you have Node installed and which version with:</p>
```
node --version
```

· [NPM] (https://www.npmjs.com/)
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

· [Nodemon] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
<p>Is not a must, but I recomend it</p>
Global:
```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```
Dependency:
```sh
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

· [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/)
<p>
  With Mongo you can work from Web Navigator or download the app.
  To connect it, you need to erase '.sample' from '.env' filename.
  The predetermined configuration works on local.
</p>

· [Postman] (https://www.postman.com/)
<p>
  In case you work without Front, you will need Postman to check the lifecycle of the API. As Mongo, you can download it or work on Web Nav.
  You'll find the last Collection created for this API on this repo.
